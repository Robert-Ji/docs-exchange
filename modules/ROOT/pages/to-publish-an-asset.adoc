When an asset is created, Exchange requires that you click Publish to complete creating the asset.
Control then passes to the edit menu where you can add a description.

If you add a description, you need to publish the asset draft content so that the description is
visible to users who utilize the asset. To publish the asset draft update,
click Publish image:ex2-publish.png[Button - Publish in the task bar].

If this icon is not visible, click Go To Draft.

After updating the description, you can add tags, share your asset, or download a copy.
